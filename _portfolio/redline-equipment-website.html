    Redline Design was started in January 2016 as a web design and development firm between myself and a partner, John Wyatt, 
    and since its inception the company has experienced steady organic growth while continually delighting customers. John serves as our 
    user experience expert with extensive experience and publications in the field of user research, and I act as the principal developer. 
    We both share similar interests in the fields of user research, design thinking, web design, and design implementation. 
    Redline primarily focuses on startups and small businesses, from company websites to web applications.

    Our client required a new website for their business to fit their brand and accomodate the feel of a larger, well-trusted organization.
    After an extensive analysis of companies' websites in similar industries and competitor websites, we provided them with a design that best matched
    their brand and incorporated common industry elements. We then implemented this design and integrated WordPress to enable client editability.
