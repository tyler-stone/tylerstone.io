<p>
    Enterprise Copy Data Analytics (eCDA) is a cloud analytics product offered by Dell EMC designed to provide a global view into the effectiveness 
    of a user's data protection operations and infrastructure using predictive and perscriptive analytics. eCDA provides features such as a 0-100
    health score, capacity forecasting for data protection hardware, and recommendations to improve the resiliency of a user's data protection environment.

    While working on eCDA, I served as a technical liason between product management, engineering, marketing, and the CTO office. I helped establish design thinking and 
    lean UX principles by pushing for quicker design iterations and frequent customer communication. I developed test plans and tested product features with customers as 
    well as internal stakeholders. Through those tests, I collected qualitative and quantitative data and helped integrate that feedback into the product. Metrics such as Net 
    Promotor Score, Customer Satisfaction, and Ease of Use served as benchmarks for improvement. I also participated in feature reviews, worked closely with product management 
    to prioritize features based on customer feedback and survey responses, and integrated passive in-product usage analytics to better understand popular and critical features 
    and workflows.
