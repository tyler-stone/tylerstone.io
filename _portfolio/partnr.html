    Partnr is an online platform for students to showcase their work from hobby projects, school projects, and internships. Through the platform, we offered 
    robust project management tools to help foster efficient group work while also enabling students to build impressive, credible portfolios. Students can create 
    projects and tasks, and work with team members to complete important project milestones. As students complete tasks, they will propagate on that userâ€™s profile 
    and he will acquire the associated skills.

    On this project, I worked with a team of 5 and served as the lead front-end engineer, leveraging HTML, CSS, and AngularJS to build a client that interfaced with a 
    REST API developed using Ruby on Rails. I was also the lead designer and led many of the exploration efforts to define the end product, the target market, and 
    the value proposition with the team.
