<p>
    Redline Design was started in January 2016 as a web design and development firm between myself and a partner, John Wyatt, 
    and since its inception the company has experienced steady organic growth while continually delighting customers. John serves as our 
    user experience expert with extensive experience and publications in the field of user research, and I act as the principal developer. 
    We both share similar interests in the fields of user research, design thinking, web design, and design implementation. 
    Redline primarily focuses on startups and small businesses, from company websites to web applications.

    Our client desired a web application to allow users to create and host hockey events. Below are some examples of the design process. 
    This project was developed in Ruby on Rails as a REST server with a HTML/CSS/JavaScript client.
